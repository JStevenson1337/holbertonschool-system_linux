The /proc filesystem
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is the /proc filesystem
What is the /proc/maps file
What is the /proc/mem file
What is the link between those two files
How does the virtual memory map into the RAM
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
Tasks
0. Hack the VM
mandatory
Write a script that finds a string in the heap of a running process, and replaces it.

Usage: read_write_heap.py pid search_string replace_string
where pid is the pid of the running process
and strings are ASCII
The script should look only in the heap of the process
Output: you can print whatever you think is interesting
On usage error, print an error message on stdout and exit with status code 1

1. Blog post #1
mandatory
Write a blog post about the /proc filesystem and the /proc/maps and /proc/mem files.

Try to explain how to parse the /proc/maps file in order to read the virtual memory.

Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on Twitter and LinkedIn.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, tweet, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
